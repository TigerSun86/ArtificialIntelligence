b. Given the values of the first six leaves, we still need to evaluate remain leaves, because last min tree may has a huge value, so after calculating, the sum value of right tree may larger than left tree

if we have seventh leaves, we need not to evaluate the eighth leaf, because these two leaves are under the same min node. because of the value of seventh is -1, so the value of the right tree is <= -0.5, but because we already have the value of left tree, this make the alpha of root is 1.5, so the biggest possible value of right tree < alpha of root, the root won't choose right path, so it's not necessary to check the eighth leaf.

c. 0 to 2
