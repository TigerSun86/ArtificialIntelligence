PlayProgram module contains TicTacToe.java

It is in charge of display various information, get input, set player and player type(human or AI), start a game

User can choose X is human or AI and O is human or AI, and also can set the intellegence level of AI. It's really funny to watch two AI in different intelligence level playing with each other.

To make AI faster at the beginning, AI will just evaluate one depth at the beginning, and after each move, AI will go deeper by a STEP, until reach the depth set by user.

About the depth. 3,4 are in at most one or two second; 5,6 are kind of smart and fast; 8 is affordable, the worst move might be 30s to 1 minute; 10 is kind of reachable, one game will take 10 to 20 minutes. 12, I still haven't get a game solved by 12.

Will it be useful and more funny to make move at beginning kind of randomly?

There is still some situations AI won't fill in spot where opponent has a obvious 3 connected. It may come from my utility evaluating or my coding error...
