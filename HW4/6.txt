States: current expression
Actions: resolve current expression with one anther expression
Goal state: empty expression
Path cost: 1 per resolution

heuristic function: the number of literals in current expression. It is admissible because one step of resolution can eliminate at most one literal, and goal state has zero literal, so if we want to arrive goal state from the current expression, we need at least number of literals steps to eliminate all literals.
