unicorn is mythical => unicorn is immortal
unicorn is not mythical => unicorn is mortal mammal
unicorn is mythical || unicorn is mammal => unicorn is horned
unicorn is horned => unicorn is magical

knowledge:
Mythical(x) => Immortal(x)
!Mythical(x) => Mammal(x)
Mythical || Mammal(x) => Horned(x)
Horned(x) => Magical(x)

clauses set:
(!Mythical(x) || Immortal(x)) &&
(Mythical(x) || Mammal(x)) &&
(!Mythical || Horned(x)) && (!Mammal(x) || Horned(x)) &&
(!Horned(x) || Magical(x))
==
{(!Mythical(x) || Immortal(x)), (Mythical(x) || Mammal(x)), (!Mythical || Horned(x)), (!Mammal(x) || Horned(x)), (!Horned(x) || Magical(x))}

!alpha1 == !Mythical(x)
!alpha2 == !Magical(x)
!alpha3 == !Horned(x)

The new resolvents set == {(Mammal(x) || Immortal(x)), (Mammal(x) || Horned(x)), (Mythical(x) || Horned(x)), (!Mythical(x) || Magical(x)), (!Mammal(x) || Magical(x)), (Immortal(x) || Magical(x)), (Mythical(x) || Horned(x)), Horned(x), Magical(x)}

add !Mythical(x) into clauses set, cannot get any empty
resolve !Magical(x) with Magical(x), it is a empty
resolve !Horned(x) with Horned(x), it is a empty
So Mythical(x) cannot be proved, but Magical(x) and Horned(x) are true.
