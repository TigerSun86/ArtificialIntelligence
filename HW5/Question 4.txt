The data files are in the submitted folder and also in the URL:

a.
To handle more than 2 classes, the I(P(pos), P(neg)) becomes I(P(class1), ...P(classN))

In this case, I changed the classes to:

x-wins win lose tie

c.
Additional attribute is "blank number", that's the number of the remain blanks in the board. The attribute is following:

blank-number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

f.
With the additional attribute, the accuracy is highly improved. For the 200 train 50 test cases, The accuracy of non-additional one is always below 0.9, and the one with additional attribute is always beyond 0.9.

One random test result is(200 train 50 test):
initial attibutes:
1.0
0.86
initial attibutes plus additional:
1.0
0.94

In less train set case(50 train 50 test), the improvement is more obvious. Here's one test result:

initial attibutes:
1.0
0.66
initial attibutes plus additional:
1.0
0.84
